In this milestone, we were tasked with creating a web application with user authentication functionality, specifically focusing on implementing user login and registration features. The project requirements included:

Front-End: Java Server Pages (JSP) to design and structure the user interface.
Back-End: Servlets to handle server-side processing, manage requests, and interact with the database.
Database: PostgreSQL, used to securely store user credentials and manage authentication data.
Deployment: The application is designed to run on an Apache Tomcat or GlassFish server for robust and scalable deployment.


This project emphasizes a secure, scalable, and efficient approach to building foundational authentication features for web applications, integrating JSP, Servlets, and PostgreSQL into a cohesive system.
